Welcome to Sigle Dog Game - an exciting game designed with you in mind!

Have you ever heard the saying, "Single people have lightning-fast hands"? Well, get ready to put that theory to the test! In this game, you'll go head-to-head against a computer opponent in a lightning-fast speed challenge. But here's the fun twist: we'll use your performance to calculate just how long you'll remain single!

Instructions:

For Mobile: Tap the screen repeatedly to decrease the number.
For Laptop/Desktop: Press the space bar repeatedly to decrease the number.

The computer is your formidable opponent, constantly decreasing the number every 0.1 seconds. Stay on your toes and maintain lightning-fast reflexes to stay ahead!

Keep tapping or pressing the space bar until the number reaches zero. The faster you deplete the number, the closer you are to breaking free from singledom!

Remember, this game is all about speed and proving that you have what it takes to leave the single zone behind. So, get those fingers ready, embrace the challenge, and show the world your lightning-fast skills!
